Until this test suite is integrated into waf you'll need to compile things as
usual and execute the following lines of code:

  $ cd t
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="../_build_/default/src/clients/lib/xmmsclient:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
  $ make test

Due to a limitation of the test suite and/or waf you'll need to have the Perl
bindings *installed* to run some of the tests.
