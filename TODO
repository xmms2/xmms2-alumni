* implement all playlist commands
* don't blindly join tokens before coll_parsing, else loose spaces
  is it okay if quotes are stripped when argv is parsed?
* if 'playlist' is entered, show that it has subcommands, somehow
+ implement add and move commands
+ list: allow patterns (still keep correct positions)
- columns: if missing info, replace by path
  or: use anders' super-smart parser for everything?
- callbacks: cleanup the code, redundancy, etc
. load configuration (file, flags) and use it
. make meaning of empty pattern configurable ('+', '_', etc)
. in inline mode, make history/state optional, and save it per
  parent-pid (shell) to avoid cross-session state.
? allow use of pipe between commands:
   xmms2 search Foo | xmms2 add
   ls Bar* | xmms2 add


done:
+ use command return value to resume looping or not
+ implement sub-tries
+ bug: parser fails if first element is a flag!
- broken quotes in shell interface?
