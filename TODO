* implement all playlist commands
* don't blindly join tokens before coll_parsing, else loose spaces
  is it okay if quotes are stripped when argv is parsed?
* if 'playlist' is entered, show that it has subcommands, somehow
+ implement add and move commands
+ list: allow patterns (still keep correct positions)
- columns: if missing info, replace by path
  or: use anders' super-smart parser for everything?
- callbacks: cleanup the code, redundancy, etc
. load configuration (file, flags) and use it


done:
+ use command return value to resume looping or not
+ implement sub-tries
+ bug: parser fails if first element is a flag!
- broken quotes in shell interface?
