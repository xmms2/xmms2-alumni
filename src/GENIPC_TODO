List of things TODO(in rough order)

* Let the server commands return values to the clientlib

* Test the server side using the stripped clientlib in my tree - Pretty much
* done, I need to start the more complex things now.

* Handle lists of complex types correctly/generate the correct code(right now
* we just skip over them) (Maybe should be before rigerous
* testing)

* Figure out how to implement property requests in the server

* Convert all of the server over to the new cmd handling api

* Clientlib needs to be converted
