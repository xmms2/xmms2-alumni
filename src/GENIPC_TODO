List of things TODO

* Figure out how to let the cmd_register functions not take an ipc argument(or
		* how to get one in the files that need to call it)

* Handle lists of complex types correctly/generate the correct code(right now  we just skip over them)

* Figure out how to implement property requests in the server

* Convert all of the server over to the new cmd handling api
