List of things TODO(in rough order)

* Handle lists of complex types correctly/generate the correct code(right now
* works for strings, dicts/propdicts are easy to add))

* Figure out how to implement property requests in the server(there is a cheesy
		* implementation of this right now, I think it will have to be
		* reworked quite a bit though before it is ready)

* Convert all of the server over to the new cmd handling api

* Clientlib needs to be converted

* Fix all the FIXMEs in genipc.py
