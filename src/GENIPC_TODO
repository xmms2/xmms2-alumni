List of things TODO(in rough order)

* Figure out why my test clientlib keeps disconnection after sending a single
* request.

* Test the server side using the stripped clientlib in my tree

* Handle lists of complex types correctly/generate the correct code(right now
* we just skip over them) (Maybe should be before rigerous
* testing)

* Figure out how to implement property requests in the server

* Convert all of the server over to the new cmd handling api

* Clientlib needs to be converted
